## CPSC 120
* Lab 2
    Lab 2 was an enjoyable lab to complete. This lab was the beginning of our programming journey, but I enjoyed being able to create such fun and interative codes. Part-1 was very simple because not much had to be done, but with this being the beginning of programming it seemed alot more complicated than it really was. Part-2 was simple as well and it was personally my favorite part. We had to create a Madlibs with funny prompts and overall when testing our program is was fun to read and complete.

* Lab 6 
    Lab 6 was one if my favorites because it allowed me to fully understand the terms and functionality of programming. Part-1 of this lab was my favorite because it was simple, but understanding how to make it work was a good challenge to test my skills. I liked the idea of building a sandwich and making sure that the arguemnts supplied were on point, making the prompt work. I would say Part-2 was the most difficult because we had to test our skills with making a program for Black Jack. The process of this was fun, and being able to program and test out this code really made me see how much work is done to make simple games that are interactive.

* Lab 9
    I would say that Lab 9 had to be one of my favorites as well because we were given interesting things to program. Part-1 was about judge scores, where we had to collect the amount of scores collected and code a function to identifity drop the lowest score and the highest score, and calculate the average. This really testing my way of thinking and put my knowledge to the test to have a program with the right outcome. Part-2 of this lab was interesting to me because we had to collect data of two philosopher's schedules, and make sure they were not going to conflict at their specific times. This program tested my knowledge about strings. Overall, it was fun to see the outcome and how the program ran in the end.
